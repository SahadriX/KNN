## 📍 KNN

A simple implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify data points based on their proximity to labeled examples. This project offers an intuitive understanding of **lazy learning models** and explores how model performance varies with different values of **k**.

---

### 🧠 Project Objective
To demonstrate how KNN can be used for classification by:
- Classifying data points based on nearest neighbors 📍  
- Understanding the impact of different **k values** on model accuracy ⚖️  
- Exploring the **bias-variance tradeoff** in lazy learning models

---

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 scikit-learn  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (optional for visualization)

---

### 🧩 Key Features
- 🔍 Classifies data points based on nearest neighbors  
- 📊 Evaluates model performance for different **k** values  
- 🎯 Provides clear visualization of decision boundaries and accuracy  
- 🧮 Helps understand **bias vs variance** behavior in KNN models

---

### 🧮 How the Model Works
1. **Load and preprocess data**  
2. **Select features and labels**  
3. **Split data** into training and testing sets  
4. **Train KNN classifier** with varying values of k  
5. **Predict and evaluate** accuracy on test data  
6. **Visualize results** to analyze impact of k
